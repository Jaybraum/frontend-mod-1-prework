## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
 As someone who has varied in career and hobby choices, the idea of being a super learner is such a valuable skillset to try new things. I have seen these super learner habits previously and one of the techniques that I have always been fond of incorporating is to teach others what you have learned. I think the idea of being able to simplify and play with information helps you to retain. For this course I’d like to incorporate more reading, I’ve found myself slacking a bit as of recently, but no worries, I’m sure this course will fill that void. One thing that I think is also important that could be added is organization, it doesn’t mean you necessarily have to be a neat freak, but understanding how information pertains to the environment you create could help.


2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
String - data type that consists of letters and other characters, this data is contained in parentheses (“ “ , ‘ ‘)
Number - a stat type that handles all numbers, negatives and decimals; it is not contained.
Boolean - a data type that evaluates one of two values; true or false. It is also not contained.

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

```Javascript
var greeting = “Hello World!”;
console.log(greeting);
```

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?
// is used for a single line comment
/* , */ would be used for multiple line comments
The purpose of code comments is to write notifications within a code for those that see the raw code. These comments will not be read as a command

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
A variable allows us to store a value. Like a word and definition in a dictionary. The word in a dictionary means something. We can write that words meaning as a definition. A variable would be the word and the definition is the value we give it.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?
- When I log into Spotify I type in my username, the variable userName gets saved and when I log in the heading might say “Hello
(userName value)”.
- When I run with my Garmin app the distance ran would save as a number data type to my phone (miles ran = number value).
- When I log into my bank app I have to login with my face id,  the app holds the value of my face in whatever stored form as a Boolean, so the when my face is scanned it matches to that value as either true or false. the true value would allow me access and the false would deny.

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is. A concatenation is a way to add variables to a string line using the + symbol as a prompt to add in a specific area.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?
Whenever there are messages that are “tailored” for you, with information you filled out when creating a profile that’s used to populate the values you gave. Messages that contain your name or age or even your height and weight for fitness apps.

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
Regarding the modulo “%” when we were asked to put 10 into 54, would that be written “54 % 10”, or “10 % 54”, I did the former.
