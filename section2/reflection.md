## Section 2 Reflection

1. **Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?**

Depending on how long I focus on something I usually determine when I ask a question. I can say that sometimes I may be stubborn, but I have to differentiate between needing to learn a process and asking for assistance. I’d say it lands somewhere in between.

1. **In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?**

I noticed that at first, and I actually opened the previous exercise to see the node command. But, the minute I realized I wouldn’t be prompted to use it anymore, I looked at the command and realized it was just the word node before the file path. Now I just type it in. I’m really a fan of the figure it out method, and with coding I feel like there is a good trial and error process that once you get down it becomes second nature.

1. **What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.**

A conditional statement is how you tell your system what function to follow based on the rules set. An example of a daily conditional is the weather, I check the weather and make conditional decisions based on the rules I set. If it’s raining I wear a rain coat, if the temperature is high, I have the choice to wear jeans or wear shorts. An example on the web would be my weather app, the display in the background would change to the weather based on the weather parameters set. So when it’s snowing the background shows snowfall, and the it is night time the app will show a dark sky in the background based on the time parameters.

1. **How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.**

You would add multiple if statements by separating the conditions with an “and” operator or an “or” operator. This will set the conditions to interact with each other. The program would go in order of the syntax displayed, so if the first condition is met then the program will move to the operator and decide whether the next statement is needed to function. If the operation is “or”(||) then it will see the condition down as true without checking the next condition. If the first condition was false then it will check if the second condition is met. For “and” (&&) both conditions will have to be true for the program to accept the condition.

1. **What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?**

I just googled and chrome dev tools gives you the option to check conditions using breakpoints. I used terminal to run the commands and looked at the error messages to determine what needed to be allowed to accept two conditions.

1. **What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?**
Just about where (“) and (‘) are used when adding a concatenation to a function. Need more practice with that!
