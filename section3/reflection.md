## Section 3 Reflection

1. **What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?**
Practicing S.M.A.R.T. goals was the first point that resonated with me. I like being organized with a plan, so anytime I see a breakdown based on setting specific and measurable goals I’m all about it. Additionally, striving to improve my Zone of Proximal Development was such a good way to look at where I am currently in my knowledge, it can work as a meter to gauge.

1. **In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?**
As I just mentioned the S.M.A.R.T. goals are something I am very familiar with. I like to map out achievable goals in short periods to accumulate to the main target. I’d say an area that I will need to improve on will be not being afraid to seek help. Seeking help is not something I don’t do entirely but it will definitely be something that I can improve on.

1. **Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.**
An example of an array could be size options when shopping on Nike’s website. Once you choose the sneaker, you are presented with an array of sizes available.

1. **In your own words, explain what an Array method is.**
An Array method is an operation that allows you to manipulate an array; you can add, subtract, lengthen.

1. **What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?**
The purpose of a Loop is to perform a task that has to be repeated. In conjunction with an array, a loop allows us to automate the data retrieval from an array.

1. **If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?**
A loop is like getting someone else to go to school for you everyday, and they do your homework and take notes for you. Then at the end of the year, They would come back and tell you everything they learned.

1. **What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?**
If setting a loop to display a message should remove the number or should it still be there along with the message? * From the final loops-array you do it *
