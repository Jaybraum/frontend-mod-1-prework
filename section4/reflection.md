## Section 4 Reflection

1. **How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?**

I added the chrome extension in the beginning of the course and I have noticed a sense of freshness after every POM. I set my pom for 30 min because I felt myself getting cut off when on a good flow. I am still playing with the times to see what works best. It will just be a case of toggling what feels good to get it just right.

1. **Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?**
I found myself a lot more focused for sure, however as I mentioned previously I am still in the process of finding the work/rest time ratio that fits best. I found myself ignoring the pom until I felt I came to a complete thought. Regarding setting intentions, I moved too fast through my lists sometimes and other times I would be stuck on something that I wouldn’t realize would take me a longer period of time to accomplish. This is understandable as i can control my understanding of the difficulty of these exercises, as time goes on I’ll have a better understanding of how long a potential task may take and be able to map out how much I can get done during the focus period.

1. **What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?**
An Object is a way to store more complex data than an array, while an array can hold a list, to my knowledge, all you can really do to an array is manipulate its length by adding and subtracting elements. An Object can contain functions and methods that can manipulate the data for you, its elements can be associated to a value.

1. **For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.**


  * List of all of the students in class - array - because it they would just a list of strings
  * List of states and their capitals - object - because it would be a list of items in relation to another for a value pair
  * List of things to pack for vacation - object/array - This list can vary with numbered items , and sub contents of lists, like  packing a toiletry bag and how much toothpaste you bring etc. However it it was single items you could make it a simple array
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow - array - if it just a list of names an array would make moresense
  * List of student names and their cohort - object - similar to states and capitals it would be easier to combine with an object
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake - object- each ingredient will have a value connected to it
  * All my favorite restaurants - array - again just a list of strings

1. **In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?**

In my Garmin app, runs are stored and calculated once the run is complete. The keys would be the distance ran and the values would be the miles that were just logged on my watch while I ran. The Object  would be the run summary and the key would be distance ran, the value would be how far my watch logged my run for with the GPS.


1. **What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?**
I still need to understand how methods interact with a class, I understand how they are executed but what part of the data is being managed and where?
